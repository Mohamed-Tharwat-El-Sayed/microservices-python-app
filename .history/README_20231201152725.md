### Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide for deploying a Python-based microservice application on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The application comprises four major microservices: `auth-server`, `converter-module(login,upload,download)`, `database-server` (PostgreSQL and MongoDB), and `notification-server`.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Create an AWS Account:** If you do not have an AWS account, create one by following the steps [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/setting-up.html).

2. **Install Helm:** Helm is a Kubernetes package manager. Install Helm by following the instructions provided [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

3. **Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. **AWS CLI:** Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) following the official [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

5. **Install kubectl:** Install the latest stable version of `kubectl` on your system. You can find installation instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

6. **Databases:** Set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB for your application.

7. **Docker:** Ensure that docker downloaded , or you can download from [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) for ubuntu

### Getting Started
### High Level steps (Flow of Application Deployment)

Follow these steps to deploy your microservice application:

1. **MongoDB and PostgreSQL Setup:** Create databases and enable automatic connections to them.

2. **RabbitMQ Deployment:** Deploy RabbitMQ for message queuing, which is required for the `converter-module`.

3. **Create Queues in RabbitMQ:** Before deploying the `converter-module`, create two queues in RabbitMQ: `mp3` and `video`.

4. **Deploy Microservices:**
   - **auth-server:** Navigate to the `auth-server` manifest folder and apply the configuration.
   - **gateway-server:** Deploy the `gateway-server`.
   - **converter-module:** Deploy the `converter-module`. 
   - **notification-server:** Configure email for notifications and two-factor authentication (2FA).Make sure to provide your email and password in `notification/manifest/secret.yaml`.

5. **Application Validation:** Verify the status of all components by running:
   ```bash
   kubectl get all
   ```
    Ensure form pv and pvc are bound

   ```bash
   kubectl get pv 
   ```
6. **Destroying the Infrastructure**  fron console



### Low Level Steps

#### 1. Cluster Creation

1. **Log in to AWS Console:**
   - Access the AWS Management Console with your AWS account credentials(Access key and Secret access key).

2. **Create eksCluster IAM Role**
   - Follow the steps mentioned in [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/service_IAM_role.html) documentation using root user , role have `AmazonEKSClusterPolicy` , `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy `
   - After creating it will look like this:

   <p align="center">
  <img src="./Project documentation/ekscluster_role.png" width="600" title="ekscluster_role" alt="ekscluster_role">
  </p>

3. **Open EKS Dashboard:**
   - Navigate to the Amazon EKS service from the AWS Console dashboard.

4. **Create EKS Cluster:**
   - Click "Create cluster."
   - Choose a name for your cluster.
   - Configure networking settings (default VPC, public subnets only).
   - attach default security group
   - Choose the `eksCluster` IAM role that was created above
   - Review and create the cluster.

5. **Cluster Creation:**
   - Wait for the cluster to provision, which may take several minutes.

6. **Cluster Ready:**
   - Once the cluster status shows as "Active," you can now create node groups.

#### 2. Node Group Creation

1. Click "Create node group."
2. In the "Compute" section, click on "Add node group."

3. **Create Node Role - AmazonEKSNodeRole**
   - Follow the steps mentioned in [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/create-node-role.html#create-worker-node-role) documentation using root user
   - Please note that you do NOT need to configure any VPC CNI policy mentioned after step 5.e under Creating the Amazon EKS node IAM role
   - Simply attach the following policies to your role once you have created `AmazonEKS_CNI_Policy` , `AmazonEBSCSIDriverPolicy` , `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` , `AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy`
    
     incase it is not attached by default
   - Your AmazonEKSNodeRole will look like this: 

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Project documentation/node_iam.png" width="600" title="Node_IAM" alt="Node_IAM">
  </p>
   4. Choose the AMI (default), instance type (e.g., t3.medium), and the number of nodes (attach a screenshot here).

5. Adding inbound rules in Security Group of Nodes

**NOTE:** Ensure that all the necessary ports are open in the node security group.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Project documentation/inbound_rules_sg.png" width="600" title="Inbound_rules_sg" alt="Inbound_rules_sg">
  </p>

6. enable addon `ebs csi` this is for enabling pvcs once cluster is created

<p align="center">
  <img src="./Project documentation/ebs_addon.png" width="600" title="ebs_addon" alt="ebs_addon">
  </p>

7. **NodeGroup Ready:**
   - Once the NodeGroup status shows as "Active," you can now start deploy.

#### 3. Deploying your application on EKS Cluster

1. Clone the code from this repository.
 Clone the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git

2. Set the cluster context:
   ```
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name <cluster_name> --region <aws_region>
   ```


### MongoDB

To install MongoDB, set the database username and password in `values.yaml`, then navigate to the MongoDB Helm chart folder and run:

```
cd Helm_charts/MongoDB
helm install mongo .
```

Connect to the MongoDB instance using:
you can get nodeip form your instance in you node.

```
mongosh mongodb://<username>:<pwd>@<nodeip>:30005/mp3s?authSource=admin
```

### PostgreSQL

Set the database username and password in `values.yaml`. Install PostgreSQL from the PostgreSQL Helm chart folder and initialize it with the queries in `init.sql`. For PowerShell users:

```
cd Helm_charts/Postqres
helm install postgres .
```

Connect to the Postgres database and copy all the queries from the "init.sql" file.
```
psql 'postgres://<username>:<pwd>@<nodeip>:30003/authdb'
```

### RabbitMQ

Deploy RabbitMQ by running:

```
cd Helm_charts/Rabbitmq
helm install rabbitmq .
```

Ensure you have created two queues in RabbitMQ named `mp3` and `video`. To create queues, visit `<nodeIp>:30004` in browser and use default username `guest` and password `guest`

**NOTE:** Ensure that all the necessary ports are open in the node security group.

### Apply the manifest file for each microservice:

- **Auth Service:**
  ```
  cd auth-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Gateway Service:**
  ```
  cd gateway-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Converter Service:**
  ```
  cd converter-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Notification Service:**
  ```
  cd notification-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

### Application Validation

After deploying the microservices, verify the status of all components by running:

```
kubectl get all
kubectl get pv
```

### Notification Configuration

For configuring email notifications and two-factor authentication (2FA), follow these steps:
1. Go to your Google Account.
2. Select Security.
3. Under "Signing in to Google," select 2-Step Verification.
4. At the bottom of the page, select App passwords.
5. Enter a name that helps you remember where youâ€™ll use the app password.
6. Select Generate.
7. To enter the app password, follow the instructions on your screen. The app password is the 16-character code that generates on your device.
8. Select Done.
9. Paste this generated password in `notification/manifest/secret.yaml` along with your email.

Run the application through the following API calls:

# API Definition

- **Login Endpoint**
  ```http request
  POST http://nodeIP:30002/login
  ```
put you email and password of your email which is on Postqrss 

  ```console
  curl -X POST http://nodeIP:30002/login -u <email>:<password>
  ``` 
  Expected output: success!

- **Upload Endpoint**
  ```http request
  POST http://nodeIP:30002/upload
  ```

  ```console
   cd ~/microservices-python-app/myvideo/
   curl -X POST -F 'file=@./video.mp4' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>' http://nodeIP:30002/upload
  ``` 
  
  Check if you received the ID on your email.

- **Download Endpoint**
  ```http request
  GET http://nodeIP:30002/download?fid=<Generated file identifier>
  ```
  ```console
   curl --output video.mp3 -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>' "http://nodeIP:30002/download?fid=<Generated fid>"
  ``` 

## Destroying the Infrastructure

To clean up the infrastructure, follow these steps:

1. **Delete the Node Group:** Delete the node group associated with your EKS cluster.

2. **Delete the EKS Cluster:** Once the nodes are deleted, you can proceed to delete the EKS cluster itself.
